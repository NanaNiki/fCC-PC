freeCodeCamp 25 + 5 Clock

A simple Pomodoro Clock application. The settings section allow the user to set the break and session length. The timer section shows a countdown timer and a label indicating the current session/break, and buttons to start/pause and reset the timer. The app is designed to help users manage their time and increase productivity.
